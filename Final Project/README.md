`make lambda-function-build` to prepare archive for AWS Lambda deploy (deploy.zip)

`make BUCKET=<your_bucket_name> create-stack` to create CloudFormation stack (lambda function, layer and IAM role)

update your lambda and add remaining dependancies as layers if any:
update lambda handler to `src/main.handler`
